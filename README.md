## configuration
```
mv <venvname>/lib/python3.8/site-packages/website/settings.py.sample <venvname>/lib/python3.8/site-packages/website/settings.py
```

in this settings.py you now have to add a django secret key.
you can create a secret key by this python oneliner : 

```python -c 'from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())'```

for a development server any random 50 character long string will do.
also if you want to use another database then the default(sqlite) you have to configure it here.

after that you will have to create a superuser and migrate django database stuff n all.

```
manage.py makemigrations
manage.py migrate
manage.py createsuperuser
```
the manage.py command will be available in your virtual environment after the installation.

now youre all set to turn on your testserver on localhost

```
manage.py runserver
```



if you want to run this application on a productive server youll have to set up a webserver and configure it according to djangos how to.
but thats on you dude!
